# Autoclicker
A tampermonkey script for clicking on all elements in a webpage that have the class autoclicker.

## Purpose:
As a web developer you need to refresh pages and spa's you are working on to check if you changes are coming through, as well as you expected.
With this script for tampermonkey, if you have to click on a lot of stuff before you can validate your code change- you can automate this step by placing the class 'autoclick' on a clickable html element and running the script.
